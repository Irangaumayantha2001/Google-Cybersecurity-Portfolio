## 👋 About Me

I am a motivated cybersecurity professional with a strong technical foundation in computer systems and networking. Through self-learning and hands-on practice with tools such as Kali Linux, Nmap, and Burp Suite, I have developed practical skills in vulnerability assessment and penetration testing.

My core values include integrity, continuous improvement, and responsibility, which guide my approach to ethical security practices. I am highly interested in identifying system weaknesses and helping organizations strengthen their defenses against cyber threats.

By combining my technical strengths, disciplined work ethic, and commitment to learning, I aim to support organizations in protecting their digital assets, maintaining business continuity, and building customer trust.
